	<p>MKC MQTT config helper for Node-Red.</p>
	
	<p>The structure of published data, the layout of the topics and their relations are not defined in the MQTT specification itself. The data 
		as well as the topics to which the data is sent to can be arbitrary.</p>
	<p>Therefore a structure of data and topics has to be defined, such that it matches the purpose of the data, is still lightweight and is 
		machine (and in best case human) readable.</p>
	<p>For this purpose MKC devices uses the <a href="https://homieiot.github.io/">homie convention</a> v4.0.0.
	You can find more information on our <a href="https://www.mkc-gmbh.de/doxygen/documentation/index.html">Online-Documentation</a></p>

	<p>This configuration creates a connection to a broker, which can be used by the MKC MQTT nodes (-device, -in and -out).</p>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p><code>Broker</code> This node requires a connection to a MQTT broker to be configured. This is configured by 
	clicking the pencil icon.</p>	
	<p><code>Root</code> The ROOT topic, without / as a hierarchy separator.</p>	
	<p><code>Device</code> The device topic, without / as a hierarchy separator. You will find it as part of the mDNS name at the product label.</p>
